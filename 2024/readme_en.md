#### Example Procedure

1. <strong>Collect resident skin bacteria by wiping human body areas such as the armpits with pieces of cotton cloth.​</strong>

    a) Prepare sterilized gauze cut into 3–5 cm squares.​  
  
    b) Collect samples from areas prone to sweating, such as both armpits, around the neck, and soles of the feet.​  
  
1. <strong>Prepare agar media (techniques that allow only specific microorganisms to grow from the countless microbial populations present in the environment) to selectively culture bacteria related to odor production among resident bacteria.​</strong>  
  
    a) Purchase reagents for culture media (for example, for Staphylococcus species, Vogel-Johnson agar medium, as specified in the consumables list above).​  
  
    b) Scoop powdered reagents from the container with a spoon, measure them using a digital scale, and place them into an Erlenmeyer flask.​  
  
    c) Measure purified water, add it to the Erlenmeyer flask, mix well, and cover with aluminum foil.​  
  
    d) Sterilize under pressure in an autoclave at 121°C for 20 minutes. Once sufficiently cooled, remove it.​  
  
    e) When it reaches an appropriate temperature, in a clean bench (for Vogel-Johnson agar medium, use a micropipette to add the specified amount of 1% potassium tellurite solution), dispense 20 mL each into Petri dishes.​  
  
    f) Let stand at room temperature until the agar solidifies.​  
  
1. <strong>Prepare multiple Petri dishes containing agar media, place the previously prepared pieces of cotton cloth on them, cover, and incubate at 37°C for 2–3 days to allow only bacteria related to odor production to proliferate.</strong>​  
  
    a) On the edge of the bottom of the Petri dish (not the lid, but the side containing the agar medium), use a permanent marker to note the date, medium name (abbreviations like FJ for Vogel-Johnson, M for Mannitol, etc.), gender, and the body part from which the sample was taken.​  
  
1. <strong>Prepare an artificial sweat solution by mixing powdered reagents with water.​</strong>  
  
    a) Measure the components of the artificial sweat solution (dissolve 50 g of lactic acid and 100 g of sodium chloride in 900 mL of purified water, then add purified water to make it up to 1 L) using a digital scale, and place them into an Erlenmeyer flask.​
  
    b) Add cholesterol or skin flakes, as a secret ingredient.​
   
    c) Dispense into conical tubes (polypropylene).​
   
1. <strong>Mix the artificial sweat solution with the bacteria from the Petri dishes. As the resident bacteria decompose the components of the sweat solution, volatile gases containing substances that are the source of the odor are generated.​</strong>  
    
    a) Scoop the colonies of cultured bacteria from the Petri dishes using sterilized loops (or toothpicks) and add them to the conical tubes prepared above.​  
  
1. <strong>Sterilize using an autoclave (high-pressure steam sterilizer). Mixing these individual odors further results in a complex scent.</strong>​
