# MetaSUB

[The MetaSUB International Consortium](http://metasub.org) aims to swab sampling of various surfaces in urban environments and subways around the world to comprehensively study the DNA of the microbial communities that live there. One of the projects is the [Global City Sampling Day (gCSD)](http://metasub.org/projects/gcsd/), which started in 2016 with simultaneous sampling worldwide on 21 June every year, and YCAM Bio Research has been also participating in this annual event since 2017.
